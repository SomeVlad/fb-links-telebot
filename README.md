# swiss-knife-bot
Telegram bot for making you happier.

For now it can do these things:
- convert youtube video to mp3. Just send the link;
- convert shitty mobile facebook links into pretty parseable desktop ones;
- in addition to unshitted m.fb link it parses (if the link is of specific type, but I'll fix that eventually) 
given post (if it's public) and creates telegra.ph page with its content (text only, actually). 
[Bugreports are welcome](https://t.me/some_vlad).
- that's it. For now.

## TODO 
[ ] make so that telegraph page gets as much content from the original post as possible (images, videos)
[ ] when this â†‘ will be working reliably, make so that link to a desktop version of a post is put into telegraph page
[ ] make so that any facebook link returns telegraph page

[There it is](https://t.me/swiss_knife_bot).
[Stay tuned](https://t.me/vladsamoylov).
